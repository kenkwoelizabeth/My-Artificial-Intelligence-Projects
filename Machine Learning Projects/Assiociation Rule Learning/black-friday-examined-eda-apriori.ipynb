The first recorded use of the term \"Black Friday\" was recorded on September 24th, 1869 when two Wall Street businessmen, Jay Gould and Jim Fisk, decided to artifically inflate the price of gold and attempted to sell it for profit. As a result of their nefarious actions, on that specific Friday in September 1869, the price of Gold dropped and the United States plunged into a state of financial devestation.\n","\n","![](http://i0.wp.com/armstrongeconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/120.png?zoom=1.5&resize=584%2C636)\n","\n","[1]: https://www.history.com/news/whats-the-real-history-of-black-friday"],"metadata":{"_uuid":"39e57998ab35a2e4dceb4a5ace7c5c11aafd561a","id":"TeCUAtMg3lER"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### First Recorded Use:\n","Various stories exist regarding the first recorded use of the term as it relates to holiday shopping, but its connotation continued to keep a negetive stigma associated with it until the late 20th century.\n","\n","\"Black Friday\" and its relation to consumerism first derived from [1950s Philadelphia][1]. Philadelphia suburbinites descended on the city after the Thanksgiving holiday, to watch the traditional Army/Navy college football game and take advantage of sales and promotions brought about by the influx of spectators to the city. Philidelphia Police Officers who were assigned to work that weekend coined the term due to their long grueling shifts and the mass amounts of people/shoppers. Philidelphia businesses also started to use the term to describe the long lines and shopping mayhem at their stores.\n","\n","[1]: https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/21/business/black-friday-history/index.html"],"metadata":{"_uuid":"09361028e2a44b27a683a62deb260c634405bba9","id":"ulQkB1dE3lES"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Use Within Business:\n","Although the term \"Black Friday\" originally represented the pitfalls of two Wall Street businessmen and the mayhem of downtown Philadephia following Thanksgiving, it is now familiarly known today as the **busiest** shopping day of the year.\n","\n","One possible explanation/rumor for the term as it relates to consumers and retailers is that \"Black Friday\" represents the first day of the year in which businesses were turning profits and accounting was done on a hand-written ledger.
